Iâ€™m [Giamir](/quirky-name), a Tech Lead specialised in UI Architecture and Design Systems looking after [Stacks](https://stackoverflow.design) (Stack Overflow's Design System).

Agile environments, cross-functional collaboration and extreme programming practices are my bread and butter.
I am an established public speaker and I have experience leading product teams to success through coaching and cultivating individuals.
I strongly believe in lifelong learning and I like to prove myself discovering new things.

Away from work I like to play videogames and spend time in Tuscany, my homeland, hiking and eating good food.
