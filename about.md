Iâ€™m [Giamir](/quirky-name), a lead developer, an agile consultant, and a user advocate based in Hamburg, Germany.

I lead the internal global frontend community at Thoughtworks together with my colleague [Rufus Raghunath](https://rufusraghunath.com/) where we draw inspiration and insights from the real-world experiences of our peers across the world.

I am an established public speaker and I have experience leading product teams to success through coaching and cultivating individuals.
I strongly believe in lifelong learning and I like to prove myself discovering new things.

Away from work I like to play videogames and spend time in Tuscany, my homeland, hiking and eating good food.
