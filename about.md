Iâ€™m [Giamir](/quirky-name), a lead developer at [ThoughtWorks](https://www.thoughtworks.com), an agile consultant, and a frontend advocate.

I lead the internal frontend community at ThoughtWorks together with my colleague [Rufus Raghunath](https://rufusraghunath.com/) where we draw inspiration and insights from the real-world experiences of our peers across the world.

Away from work I like to play videogames and spend time in Tuscany, my homeland, hiking and eating good food.
